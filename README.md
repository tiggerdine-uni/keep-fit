# Keep Fit

My first Android app, Keep Fit, is a pedometer that:
 - shows the current day status
 - manages a number of goals
 - keeps a persistent history of daily information
 - allows historical recording of activity on any past date
 - supports user preferences and settings
 - notifies users when 50% of their day's goal has been met
 - suppots automatic recording of activity using a step counter
